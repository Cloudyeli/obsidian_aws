An event bus receives events from a source, uses rules to evaluate them, applies any configured input transformation, and routes them to the appropriate target(s). Your account's default event bus receives events from AWS services. A custom event bus can receive events from your custom applications and services. A partner event bus receives events from an event source created by an [[SaaS]] partner. These events come from the partners services or applications.
