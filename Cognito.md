## AWS Cognito

Amazon Cognito lets you easily add user sign-up and authentication to your mobile and web apps. Amazon Cognito also enables you to authenticate users through an external identity provider and provides temporary security credentials to access your app’s backend resources in AWS or any service behind Amazon API Gateway. Amazon Cognito works with external identity providers that support SAML or OpenID Connect ([[OIDC]]), social identity providers (such as Facebook, Twitter, Amazon) and you can also integrate your own identity provider.

In addition, Amazon Cognito enables you to synchronize data across a user’s devices so that their app experience remains consistent when they switch between devices or upgrade to a new device. Your app can save data locally on users’ devices allowing your applications to work even when the devices are offline and then automatically synchronize the data when the device is back online.

With Amazon Cognito, you can focus on creating great app experiences instead of worrying about building, securing, and scaling a solution to handle user management, authentication, and sync across platforms and devices.
