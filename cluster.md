A Cluster Placement Group packs instances **phisical** close together inside an [[AZ]] (in same rack or in adjacent racks).

*  Uses enhanced networking, low network latency and high throughput for inter- instance traffic.
*   This strategy enables workloads to achieve the **low-latency** network performance necessary for **tightly-coupled** node-to-node communication that is typical of **[[HPC]] applications**.
