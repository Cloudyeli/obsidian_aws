## AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On ([[SSO]]))

AWS IAM Identity Center is where you create, or connect, your workforce users once and centrally manage their access to multiple AWS accounts and applications. You can create user identities directly in IAM Identity Center, or you canÂ connect your existing identity source, including Microsoft [[AD]] and standards-based identity providers, such as Okta Universal Directory or Azure [[AD]]. You can choose to manage access just to AWS accounts, just to cloud applications, or to both. Your users can utilize their existing credentials for one-click access to their assigned AWS accounts, AWS applications, like Amazon [[SageMaker]] Studio, and other standards-based cloud applications, like Salesforce, Box, and Microsoft 365.
