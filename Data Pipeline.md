AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that helps you reliably process and move data between different AWS compute and storage services, as well as on-premises data sources, at specified intervals.
With AWS Data Pipeline, you can regularly access your data where itâ€™s stored, transform, and process it at scale, and efficiently transfer the results to AWS services such as Amazon [[S3]], Amazon [[RDS]], Amazon [[DynamoDB]], and Amazon [[EMR]].

-   AWS Data Pipeline helps you easily create complex data processing workloads that are fault tolerant, repeatable, and highly available.
*   Processes and moves data between different AWS compute and storage services
