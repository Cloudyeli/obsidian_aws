## AWS Patch Manager
#(AWS [[Systems Manager]])

AWS [[Systems Manager]] helps you select and deploy operating system and software patches automatically across large groups of cloud or on-premises instances and edge devices. Through patch baselines, you can set rules to auto-approve select categories of patches to be installed, such as operating system or high severity patches, and specify a list of patches that override these rules and are automatically approved or rejected. You can also schedule maintenance windows for your patches so that they are only applied during preset times. Systems Manager helps ensure that your software is up-to-date and meets your compliance policies.
