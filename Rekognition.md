### AWS Rekognition Video

Rekognition Video is a video recognition service that detects activities; understands the movement of people in frame; and recognizes objects, celebrities, and inappropriate content in videos stored in Amazon [[S3]] and live video streams from Acuity. Rekognition Video detects persons and tracks them through the video even when their faces are not visible, or as the whole person might go in and out of the scene. For example, this could be used in an application that sends a real-time notification when someone delivers a package to your door. Rekognition Video allows you also to index metadata like objects, activities, scene, celebrities, and faces that make video search easy.
