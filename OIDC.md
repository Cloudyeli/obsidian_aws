## OpenID Connect (OIDC) 

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an open authentication protocol that works on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework. Targeted toward consumers, OIDC allows individuals to useÂ single sign-on ([[SSO]]) to access relying party sites using OpenID Providers (OPs), such as an email provider or social network, to authenticate their identities. It provides the application or service with information about the user, the context of their authentication, and access to their profile information.

  
The purpose of OIDC is for users to provide one set of credentials and access multiple sites. Each time users sign on to an application or service using OIDC, they are redirected to their OP, where they authenticate and are then redirected back to the application or service.
