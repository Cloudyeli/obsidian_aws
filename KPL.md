## Kinesis Producer Library (KPL)

An Amazon [[Kinesis Data Streams]] producer is an application that puts user data records into a Kinesis data stream (also calledÂ _data ingestion_). The Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) simplifies producer application development, allowing developers to achieve high write throughput to a Kinesis data stream.

You can monitor the KPL with Amazon [[CloudWatch]].
