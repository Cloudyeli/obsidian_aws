## IAM Access Advisor (user-level)  

IAM enables you to automate the analysis of your IAM permissions across all your accounts using IAM access advisor APIs with the (AWS [[CLI]]) or [[SDK]]. 

*   IAM access advisor helps you audit service access, remove unnecessary permissions, and set appropriate permissions providing the last timestamp when an IAM entity (e.g.,[[ IAM user]], [[IAM role]], or a [[IAM group]]) accessed an AWS service.
*   Shows the service permissions granted to a [[IAM user]] and when those services were last accessed.  
*   You can use this information to revise your [[policies]].
