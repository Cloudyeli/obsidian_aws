Memcached is a general-purpose distributed memory-caching system. It is often used to speed up dynamic database-driven websites by caching data and objects in RAM to reduce the number of times an external data source must be read. Memcached is free and open-source software.

Memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but originally intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.

You can think of it as a short-term memory for your applications.

Memcached allows you to take memory from parts of your system where you have more than you need and make it accessible to areas where you have less than you need.
