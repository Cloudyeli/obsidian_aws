## Application Migration Service (MGN)

**AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)** is the primary migration service recommended for lift-and-shift migrations to AWS. Customers currently using Server Migration Service ([[SMS]]) are encouraged to switch to Application Migration Service for future migrations.

AWS Application Migration Service simplifies and expedites your migration to the cloud. It allows you to quickly realize the benefits of migrating applications to the cloud without changes and with minimal downtime.   

With AWS Application Migration Service, you can migrate your applications from physical infrastructure, VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ([[EC2]]), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud ([[VPC]]), and other clouds to AWS.

### Benefits

##### Easy to get started

Start and manage server migration with [AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sms/index.html). AWS Server Migration Service will automatically replicate live server volumes to AWS and create Amazon Machine Images (AMI) as needed.  

##### Control

Create and manage a customized replication schedule designed for large-scale migrations, and track the progress of each migration.  

##### Agility

Perform migrations faster while minimizing network bandwidth, by migrating only incremental changes made to on-premises servers.  

##### Cost-effective

AWS Server Migration Service is free to use; pay only for the storage resources used during the migration process. [Learn more](https://aws.amazon.com/server-migration-service/pricing/).
