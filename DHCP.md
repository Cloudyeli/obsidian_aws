## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol networks for automatically assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to the network using a client–server architecture.

## How does DHCP work?

DHCP is a network management protocol. A client device (or DHCP client), such as a laptop, joins a network and requests an IP address. The request is made to a DHCP server.

These servers are often configured with redundancy—often called [DHCP failover](https://bluecatnetworks.com/resources/how-to-configure-dhcp-failover/)—or clustering among other network servers. Servers can run on both [IPv4](https://bluecatnetworks.com/glossary/what-is-ipv4/) and IPv6 networks.
