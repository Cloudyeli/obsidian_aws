In the simplest terms, a batch job is a scheduled program that is assigned to run on a computer without further user interaction. Batch jobs are often queued up during working hours, then executed during the evening or weekend when the computer is idle.

Once the batch job is submitted, the job enters into a queue where it waits until the system is ready to process the job. If the job queue contains many jobs waiting to be processed, the system processes the jobs either in chronological order or by priority.

Batch jobs are frequently used to automate tasks that need to be performed on a regular basis, like payroll, but donâ€™t necessarily need to occur during the day or have an employee interacted with the system. Jobs that happen on a regular basis are incorporated into batch schedules.

In some computer systems, batch jobs run in the background while interactive programs run in the foreground, giving these interactive programs priority over batch programs. This makes sense because batch jobs are provided with more allocated memory than those performed in the foreground. They are used to process high volumes of data that would normally consume long-term memory if run in the foreground.

The most valuable benefits of batch jobs include:

-   Large programs can utilize more dedicated servers when the work processes are in night mode.
-   With fewer users or employees online during off hours, the performance will be faster and more efficient at night. During the day it could be restricted to fewer servers and numbers needed.
-   Employees are freed up to focus on less repeatable, more creative tasks.
