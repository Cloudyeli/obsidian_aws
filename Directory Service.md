## AWS Directory Service
* ### AWS [[Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory]]
* ### AWS [[AD Connector]]
* ### AWS [[Simple AD]]


AWS Directory Service provides multiple ways to use Microsoft Active Directory ([[AD]]) with other AWS services. Directories store information about users, groups, and devices, and administrators use them to manage access to information and resources. AWS Directory Service provides multiple directory choices for customers who want to use existing Microsoft AD or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)–aware applications in the cloud. It also offers those same choices to developers who need a directory to manage users, groups, devices, and access.

| I need Active Directory or [[LDAP]] for my applications in the cloud | - Select AWS [[Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory]] (Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition) if you need an actual Microsoft Active Directory in the AWS Cloud that supports Active Directory–aware workloads, or AWS applications and services such as Amazon [[WorkSpaces]] and Amazon [[QuickSight]], or you need [[LDAP]] support for Linux applications.<br> - Use [[AD Connector]] if you only need to allow your on-premises users to log in to AWS applications and services with their Active Directory credentials. - You can also use [[AD Connector]] to join Amazon [[EC2]] instances to your existing Active Directory domain.<br> - Use [[Simple AD]] if you need a low-scale, low-cost directory with basic Active Directory compatibility that supports Samba 4–compatible applications, or you need [[LDAP]] compatibility for LDAP-aware applications. |
