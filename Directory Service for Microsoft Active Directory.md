## AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory
#(AWS [[Directory Service]])

AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, also known as AWS Managed Microsoft AD, activates your directory-aware workloads and AWS resources to use managed AD on AWS.

-   Fully managed AWS services on AWS infrastructure
-   Best choice if you have more than 5000 users and/or need a trust relationship set up
-   You can setup trust relationships to extend authentication from on-premises Active Directories into the AWS cloud
-   On-premise users and groups can access resources in either domain using [[SSO]]
-   Can be used as a standalone [[AD]] in the AWS cloud

*   Select AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition) if you need an actual Microsoft Active Directory in the AWS Cloud that supports Active Directoryâ€“aware workloads, or AWS applications and services such as Amazon [[WorkSpaces]] and Amazon [[QuickSight]], or you need [[LDAP]] support for Linux applications.
