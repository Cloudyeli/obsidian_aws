AWS Fargate is a [[serverless]], pay-as-you-go compute engine that lets you focus on building applications without managing servers. AWS Fargate is compatible with both Amazon Elastic Container Service ([[ECS]]) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service ([[EKS]]).

*   Deploy and manage your applications, not infrastructure. Fargate removes the operational overhead of scaling, patching, securing, and managing servers.
*   Monitor your applications via built-in integrations with AWS services like Amazon [[CloudWatch Container Insights]]. Gather metrics and logs with third-party tools.
