## AWS Session Manager
#(AWS [[Systems Manager]])

AWS Systems Manager provides a browser-based interactive shell, [[CLI]] and browser based remote desktop access for managing instances on your cloud, or on-premises and edge devices, without the need to open inbound ports, manage Secure Shell ([[SSH]]) keys, or use [[bastion host]]s. Administrators can grant and revoke access to instances through a central location by using AWS Identity and Access Management ([[IAM]]) policies. This allows you to control which users can access each instance, including the option to provide non-root access to specified users. Once access is provided, you can audit which user accessed an instance and log each command to Amazon Simple Storage Service ([[S3]]) or Amazon [[CloudWatch]] Logs using AWS [[CloudTrail]].

*   Secure remote management of your instances at scale without logging into your servers
-   connect securely without [[bastion host]]s, [[SSH]], [[RDP]] or remote PowerShell
