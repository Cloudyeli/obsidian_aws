## Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS)

-   Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) is a managed [**Kubernetes**](https://aws.amazon.com/kubernetes/) service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane.
-   EKS is certified Kubernetes conformant, so existing applications running on upstream Kubernetes are compatible with Amazon EKS.
-   EKS automatically manages the availability and scalability of the Kubernetes control plane [[node]]s that are responsible for starting and stopping [**containers**](https://aws.amazon.com/what-are-containers/), scheduling containers on virtual machines, storing cluster data, and other tasks.
-   EKS automatically detects and replaces unhealthy control plane nodes for each cluster.
-   Generally available but only in limited regions currently.
