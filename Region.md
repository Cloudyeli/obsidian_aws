## Part of: [[AWS Global Infrastructure]]

*   A Region is a physical location in the world and is independent
*   Each region consists of two or more Availability Zones ([[AZ]]s)
*   A region is a geographical area  
*   Every region is connected via a high bandwidth, fully redundant network
*   Isolated from other AWS Regions
*   There are 26+ regions around the world
*   [[Local Zone]]s extend regions closer to end-users
*   You can replicate data within a region and between regions using private or public Internet connections.
*   You retain complete control and ownership over the region in which your data is physically located, making it easy to meet regional compliance and data residency requirements.

**==Note that there is a charge for data transfer between regions.==**
