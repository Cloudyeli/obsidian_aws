## AWS Simple AD
#(AWS [[Directory Service]])

Simple AD is **a Microsoft Active Directory–compatible directory from AWS Directory Service that is powered by Samba 4**.
Simple AD supports basic Active Directory features such as user accounts, group memberships, joining a Linux domain or Windows based EC2 instances, Kerberos-based SSO, and group policies.

*   Use Simple AD if you need a low-scale, low-cost directory with basic Active Directory compatibility that supports Samba 4–compatible applications, or you need [[LDAP]] compatibility for LDAP-aware applications.
