## AWS EMR (previously called Amazon Elastic MapReduce)

Amazon EMR provides a managed [[Hadoop]] framework that makes it easy, fast, and cost-effective to process vast amounts of data across dynamically scalable Amazon [[EC2]] instances.

You can also run other popular distributed frameworks such as [**Apache Spark**](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/details/spark/), [**HBase**](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/details/hbase/), [**Presto**](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/details/presto/), and [**Flink**](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/use-apache-flink-on-amazon-emr/) in Amazon EMR, and interact with data in other AWS data stores such as Amazon [[S3]] and Amazon [[DynamoDB]].
Amazon EMR securely and reliably handles a broad set of big data use cases, including **log analysis**, **web indexing**,** data transformations** ([[ETL]]), **machine learning** ([[ML]]), **financial analysis**, **scientific simulation**, and **bioinformatic**.

-   Managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks including Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark
-   Used for processing data for analytics and business intelligence
-   Can also be used for transforming and moving large amounts of data
-   Performs extract, transform, and load ([[ETL]]) functions
