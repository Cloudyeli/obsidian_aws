## Intrusion detection system (IDS)

An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors and detects behaviour across a network and should be considered a diagnostic solution. The system, if it detects something problematic, will alert the security team so they can investigate.
An [[IPS]] solution has more agency and takes action when a potential attack, malicious behaviour, or an unauthorised user is detected.

### Comparison: 

*   An IDS is more of an alerting system that lets an organisation know if anomalous orÂ malicious activity is detected. 
*   An [[IPS]] takes this detection a step forward and shuts down the network before access can be gained or to prevent further movement in a network.
