### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space.

IaaS provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is very similar to the existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.
