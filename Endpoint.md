Public services have public IP addresses / endpoints.

An endpoint is a URL that is the entry point for a web service.

For example, https://dynamodb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com is an entry point for the Amazon DynamoDB service.

## Regions and Endpoints:

-   When you work with an instance using the command line interface ([[CLI]]) or [[API]] actions, you must specify its regional endpoint.
-   To reduce data latency in your applications, most Amazon Web Services offer a regional endpoint to make your requests.
