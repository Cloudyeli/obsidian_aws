## EC2 Status Check:

##### - [[System Status Check]]
*   Checks that the underlying hardware on which your [[EC2]] instance is running, is working operationally.
*   If there is a problem with a system status check, it means that AWS are going to need to be involved to actually fix that problem.
##### - [[Instance Status Check]]
*   AWS is checking the software networking configuration of your [[EC2]] instance itself.
*   Makes shure that the [[OS]] is configured correctly, so that your [[EC2]] instance is operational and it's communicating with the network
*   If there is a problem with the Instance status check, it means it would need your involvment as an AWS customer to fix that problem.
