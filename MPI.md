The message passing interface (MPI) is a standardized means of exchanging messages between multiple computers running a parallel program across distributed memory.

In [parallel](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/parallel) computing, multiple computers – or even multiple processor cores within the same computer – are called nodes. Each node in the parallel arrangement typically works on a portion of the overall computing problem. The challenge then is to synchronize the actions of each parallel node, exchange data between nodes, and provide command and control over the entire parallel cluster. The message passing interface defines a standard suite of functions for these tasks. The term _message passing_ itself typically refers to the sending of a message to an object, parallel process, subroutine, function or thread, which is then used to start another process.
