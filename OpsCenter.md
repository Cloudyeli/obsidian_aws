## AWS OpsCenter
#(AWS [[Systems Manager]])

OpsCenter provides a central location where operations engineers and IT professionals can view, investigate, and resolve operational issues related to AWS resources.Â OpsCenter aggregates and standardizes operational issues, referred to as OpsItems, while providing contextually relevant data that helps with diagnosis and remediation. Engineers working on an OpsItem get access to information such as:

-   Event, resource and account details
-   Past OpsItems with similar characteristics
-   Related AWS [[Config]] changes
-   AWS [[CloudTrail]] logs
-   Amazon [[CloudWatch]] alarms
-   Stack information
-   Quick-links to access logs and metrics
-   List of runbooks and recommended runbooks
-   Other information passed to OpsCenter through AWS services

This information helps engineers to investigate and remediate operational issues faster. Engineers can use OpsCenter to view and address issues using the Systems Manager console or via the Systems Manager OpsCenter [[API]]s.
