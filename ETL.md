## Extract, Transform and Load 

If you have data from multiple sources that you want to bring into a centralized database,Â **you need to:**

**EXTRACT** 
	the data from its original source, whether that is another database or an application,
**TRANSFORM** 
	the data by cleaning it up, deduplicating it, combining it and otherwise getting ready to
**LOAD**    
    the data into the target database.
