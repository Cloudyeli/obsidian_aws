## AWS AD Connector
#(AWS [[Directory Service]])

AD Connector isÂ **a directory gateway with which you can redirect directory requests to your on-premises Microsoft Active Directory without caching any information in the cloud**. AD Connector comes in two sizes, small and large.

-   AD Connector is a directory gateway for redirecting directory requests to your on-premise Active Directory.
-   AD Connector eliminates the need for directory synchronization and the cost and complexity of hosting a federation infrastructure
-   Connects your existing on-premise [[AD]] to AWS
-   Best choice when you want to use an existing Active
    Directory with AWS services.

*   Use AD Connector if you only need to allow your on-premises users to log in to AWS applications and services with their Active Directory credentials. 
*    You can also use AD Connector to join Amazon [[EC2]] instances to your existing Active Directory domain.
