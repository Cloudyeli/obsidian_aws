Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Cloud computing provides a simple way to access servers, storage, databases, and a broad set of application services over the Internet.

A cloud services platform such as Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

• Run all parts of the application in the cloud
• Migrate existing applications to the cloud
• Design and build new applications in the cloud

## [[The 6 Advantages of Cloud]]

You must understand the following 6 advantages of cloud:

1.  Trade capital expense for variable/operational expense.
2.  Benefit from massive economies of scale.
3.  Stop guessing about capacity.
4.  Increase speed and agility.
5.  Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers.
6.  Go global in minutes.

## [[Cloud Computing Models]]

There are 3 common types of cloud computing model that come up in the exam:

1.  Infrastructure as a service ([[IaaS]]).
2.  Platform as a service ([[PaaS]]).
3.  Software as a service ([[SaaS]]).

## [[Types of Cloud Deployment]]

There are 4 common types of cloud deployment that come up in the exam:

1.  [[Public Cloud]] – e.g. AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
2.  [[Hybrid Cloud]] – a mixture of public and private clouds.
3.  [[Private Cloud]] (on-premises) – a cloud managed in your own data center, e.g. Hyper-V, OpenStack, VMware.
4. [[Multicloud]] – use private/public clouds from multiple providers

## Fundamentals of [[Pricing]]:  

• Compute – CPU/RAM and duration  
• Storage – quantity of data stored or allocated  
• Outbound data transfer – data leaving an AWS Region

## [[AWS Shared Responsibility Model]]

The AWS shared responsibility model defines customer/AWS responsibilities:

AWS are responsible for “Security of the Cloud”:

* AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud
* This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services

Customers are responsible for “Security in the Cloud”:

* For EC2 this includes network level security, operating system patches and updates, IAM user access management, and client and server-side data encryption
