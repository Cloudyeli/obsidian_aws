AWS Direct Connect is **a network service that provides an alternative to using the Internet to utilize AWS cloud services**. AWS Direct Connect enables customers to have low latency, secure and private connections to AWS for workloads which require higher speed or lower latency than the internet.

*   **Avoids the public Internet**
*   Private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter / office (**Private connection from on-premises to AWS**)
*   Consistent network experience – **increased speed/latency & bandwidth/throughput**  
*   Lower costs for organizations that transfer **large volumes of data**
