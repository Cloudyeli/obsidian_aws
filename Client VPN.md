## AWS Client VPN

AWS Client VPN enables you to securely connect users to AWS or on-premises networks.

-   AWS Client VPN is a fully managed VPN service that enables secure access to Amazon Virtual Private Clouds ([[VPC]]s) and on-premises resources.
-   It uses the OpenVPN protocol and supports both [[TCP]] and [[UDP]] connections.
-   AWS Client VPN can be used to connect to AWS resources and services, as well as to on-premises resources, from a remote location.
-   It supports client authentication using Active Directory ([[AD]]), Okta, or  [[SSL]]/[[TLS]] (443) certificates.
-   The service automatically scales to handle the number of [[VPN]] connections, eliminating the need for customers to manage their own [[VPN]] hardware.
-   It provides access to AWS resources over the Internet or through a [[VPC endpoint]], ensuring a secure and highly available connection.
-   AWS Client VPN integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management ([[IAM]]) and Amazon VPC [[security group]]s, allowing customers to control access to resources based on specific identity and security [[policies]].
-   The service provides detailed logs and metrics, enabling customers to monitor and troubleshoot [[VPN]] connections.
