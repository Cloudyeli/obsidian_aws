**Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)** is a category of software that allows users to analyze information from multiple [[database]] systems at the same time. It is a technology that enables analysts to extract and view business data from different points of view.

Analysts frequently need to group, aggregate and join data. These OLAP operations in data mining are resource intensive. With OLAP data can be pre-calculated and pre-aggregated, making analysis faster.

OLAP databases are divided into one or more cubes. The cubes are designed in such a way that creating and viewing reports become easy. OLAP stands for Online Analytical Processing.

OLAP Cube

At the core of the OLAP concept, is an OLAP Cube. The OLAP cube is a data structure optimized for very quick data analysis.  

The OLAP Cube consists of numeric facts called measures which are categorized by dimensions. OLAP Cube is also called the **hypercube**.

Usually, data operations and analysis are performed using the simple spreadsheet, where data values are arranged in row and column format. This is ideal for two-dimensional data. However, OLAP contains multidimensional data, with data usually obtained from a different and unrelated source. Using a spreadsheet is not an optimal option. The cube can store and analyze multidimensional data in a logical and orderly manner.
