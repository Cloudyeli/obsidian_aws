Nitro is the underlying platform for the next generation of [[EC2]] instances.
 
-   Breaks logical functions into specialized hardware with a Nitro Hypervisor
-   Support for many virtualized and bare metal instance types


Specialized hardware includes:

-   Nitro cards for [[VPC]]
-   Nitro cards for [[EBS]]  
-   Nitro for Instance Storage
-   Nitro card controller  
-   Nitro security chip  
-   Nitro hypervisor  
-   [[Nitro Enclave]]s

Improves performance, security and innovation:

-   Performance close to [[bare metal]] for virtualized instances
-   Elastic Network Adapter ([[ENA]]) and Elastic Fabric Adapter ([[EFA]])
-   More bare metal [[instance type]]s
-   Higher network performance (e.g. 100 Gbps)
-   High Performance Computing ([[HPC]]) optimizations
-   Dense storage instances (e.g. 60 TB)

==**Key takeaway: AWS Nitro systems is the next generation of the underlying hardware platform for EC2. It breaks apart various functions into these different modules like the Nitro cards and the Nitro security chip.**==
