An intrusion prevention system (IPS) has the same functionality as [[IDS]] systems in terms of detection but also contains response capabilities. An IPS solution has more agency and takes action when a potential attack, malicious behavior, or an unauthorized user is detected.

The specific functions of an IPS depend on the type of solution, but in general, having an IPS in place is helpful to automate actions and contain threats without the need for an administrator.

### Comparison:

*   An [[IDS]] is more of an alerting system that lets an organization know if anomalous or malicious activity is detected. 
* . An IPS takes this detection a step forward and shuts down the network before access can be gained or to prevent further movement in a network.
