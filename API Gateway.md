## AWS API Gateway

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure [[API]]s at any scale.

With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can create an API that acts as a “front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services.

-   Back-end services may include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ([[EC2]]), code running on AWS [[Lambda]], or any web application.
-   Publish [[API]]s on AWS
-   Create RESTful and WebSocket APIs
-   Fully managed service
-   Forward connections to AWS services and on-premises applications
