##### Cookies:
*   Load Balancer generated [[cookie]]
*   Application-based [[cookie]].

Both of them are generated by the ELB. They are not generated by the application.
The key difference is, with a load balancer generated cookie, the cookie Name is always **AWS ALB**. So if you have multiple layers of load balancer in your architecture, then the cookie name is going to be the same and that could be a problem.
You can then use an application-based cookie and then for each [[target group]] you can specify a different cookie name.

##### Storing session state data
*  Session data such as authentication details stored in [[DynamoDB]] Table
*   [[ElastiCache]] is also a popular solution for storing session-state data
*   User does not need to re-authenticate

##### Sticky session
*   Session data such as authentication details stored **locally**
*   If an instance fails, session state is lost – use with **session state store** for more resiliency
*   Cookie is generated and client bound to instance for **cookie lifetime**

*   **Group-level stickiness**: If a target group is sticky, requests routed to it remain in that [[target group]] for the duration of the session. 
*   **Individual target stickiness** is a configuration of the [[target group]].
