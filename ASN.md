## utonomous System Number (AS number or just ASN)
An Autonomous System Number (_AS number_ or just _ASN_) is a special number assigned by IANA used primarilly with Border Gateway Protocol which uniquely identifies an network under a single technical administration that has a unique routing policy, or is multi-homed to the public internet. This autonomous system number is required if you are to run BGP and peer with your internet service provider and between internet service providers at peering points and Internet Exchanges ([[IX]]).  The ASN must be globally unique so that IP address blocks appear to come from a unique location that [[BGP]] can find and route to. BGP uses Prefixes and Autonomous System Paths (AS Paths) to determine the shortest path to a destination where a prefix is located.
