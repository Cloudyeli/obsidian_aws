AWS Lambda is a [[serverless]] computing technology that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers.

AWS Lambda executes code only when needed and scales automatically.

### Benefits of AWS Lambda:

-   No servers to manage.
-   Continuous scaling.
-   Millisecond billing.
-   Integrates with almost all other AWS services.

### Primary use cases for AWS Lambda:

-   Data processing.
-   Real-time file processing.
-   Real-time stream processing.
-   Build serverless backends for web, mobile, [[IOT]], and 3rd party [[API]] requests.

==You pay only for the compute time you consume (you pay nothing when your code is not running).
