## AWS CloudShell

AWS CloudShell isÂ **a browser-based, pre-authenticated shell that you can launch directly from the AWS Management Console**. You can run AWS [[CLI]] commands against AWS services using your preferred shell ([[Bash]], PowerShell, or Z shell). And you can do this without needing to download or install command line tools.
