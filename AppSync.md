## AWS AppSync

AWS AppSync makes it easy to build data-driven mobile and browser-based apps that deliver responsive, collaborative experiences by **keeping the data updated when devices are connected**, **enabling the app to use local data when offline**, and **synchronizing the data when the devices reconnect**.

-   AWS AppSync uses the open standard [[GraphQL]] query language so you can request, change, and subscribe to the exact data you need with just a few lines of code.
