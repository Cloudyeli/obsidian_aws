Amazon S3 is object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere – web sites and mobile apps, corporate applications, and data from [[IoT]] sensors or devices.

*   You can store any type of file in S3.
*   Files can be anywhere from 0 bytes to 5 TB
-   There is unlimited storage available
-   S3 is a universal namespace so bucket names must be unique globally
-   However, you create your buckets within a [[REGION]]
-   It is a best practice to create buckets in regions that are physically closest to your users to reduce latency
-   S3 is designed to deliver 99.999999999% durability, and stores data for millions of applications used by market leaders in every industry.

S3 provides comprehensive security and compliance capabilities that meet even the most stringent regulatory requirements.

S3 gives customers flexibility in the way they manage data for cost optimization, access control, and compliance.

Typical use cases include:

-   **Backup and Storage** – Provide data backup and storage services for others.
-   **Application Hosting** – Provide services that deploy, install, and manage web applications.
-   **Media Hosting** – Build a redundant, scalable, and highly available infrastructure that hosts video, photo, or music uploads and downloads.
-   **Software Delivery** – Host your software applications that customers can download.
-   **Static Website** – you can configure a static website to run from an S3 bucket.

S3 provides query-in-place functionality, allowing you to run powerful analytics directly on your data at rest in S3. And Amazon S3 is the most supported cloud storage service available, with integration from the largest community of third-party solutions, systems integrator partners, and other AWS services.

*   Files can be anywhere from 0 bytes to 5 TB.
*   There is unlimited storage available.
*   Files are stored in buckets.
*   Buckets are root level folders.
*   Any subfolder within a bucket is known as a “folder”.

### AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)

- ##### S3 Standard (frequent access)
(durable, immediately available, frequently accessed).
- ##### S3 Intelligent-Tiering 
(automatically moves data to the most cost-effective tier).
- ##### S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)
(durable, immediately available, infrequently accessed).
- ##### S3 One Zone-IA (Infrequent Access)
(lower cost for infrequently accessed data with less resilience).

## AWS [[S3 Glacier]]

- ##### S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval 
(data that is rarely accessed and requires retrieval in milliseconds).
- ##### S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly S3 Glacier)
(archived data, retrieval times in minutes or hours).
- ##### S3 Glacier Deep Archive 
(lowest cost storage class for long term retention).

-   Extremely low cost and you pay only for what you need with no commitments of upfront fees
-   Two classes Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive

*   **Transfer acceleration** – speeds up uploads using [[CloudFront]] 
*   **Requester pays** – the account requesting the objects pays  
*   **Events** – can trigger notifications to [[SNS]], [[SQS]] and Lambda  
*   **Static website hosting** – setup a static websites
*   **Encryption** – encrypt objects in the bucket  
*   **Replication** – replicate within ([[SRR]]) or across ([[CRR]]) Regions

### S3 Versioning

-   Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket
-   Use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket
-   Versioning-enabled buckets enable you to recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite

### S3 Object Lock

-   Store objects using a write-once-read-many ([[WORM]]) model
-   Prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed time or indefinitely

### S3 Glacier Vault Lock

*   Also used to enforce a [[WORM]] model  
*   Can apply a policy and lock the policy from future edits
*   Use for compliance objectives and data retention

## AWS [[S3]] Pricing

- ##### Storage class
e.g. Standard or IA

- ##### Storage quantity
data volume stored in your buckets on a per GB basis

- ##### Number of requests
the number and type of requests, e.g. GET, PUT, POST, LIST, COPY 

* ##### Lifecycle transitions requests
moving data between storage classes
    
- ##### Data transfer
data transferred out of an S3 [[region]] is charged
