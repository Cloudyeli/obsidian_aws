The difference between the different tier (or layer) architectures lies in the distribution of responsibilities across the different components within the system.

1.  Single-Tier Architecture: In this architecture, the application is hosted on a single server and all components (e.g. the web server, application server, and database server) are on the same machine.
    
2.  Two-Tier Architecture: In this architecture, the application is split into two parts, with a client tier and a server tier. The client tier interacts with the user, while the server tier interacts with the database.
    
3.  Three-Tier Architecture: In this architecture, the application is split into three parts: the client tier, the application server tier, and the database tier. The client tier interacts with the user, the application server tier performs business logic and application management, and the database tier manages the data storage.
    
4.  N-Tier Architecture: This architecture extends the three-tier architecture to include additional tiers. The additional tiers can be used to add additional services such as security, load balancing, or caching.
    

The distinction between the different tier architectures is important because it determines how the application will scale, how it can be managed, and how it can be secured.
