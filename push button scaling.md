Push-button scaling refers to the process of increasing or decreasing the capacity of a system by simply pressing a button or clicking a command, rather than manually configuring or provisioning additional resources. This allows organisations to quickly respond to changing resource demands, such as spikes in traffic or increased computational needs, without the need for manual intervention. In the context of cloud computing, push-button scaling typically involves the automatic provisioning of additional virtual machines, storage capacity, or other resources, based on pre-defined scaling rules or policies. This helps organisations to ensure that their systems have the resources they need to meet the demands of their applications, while also reducing the costs associated with over-provisioning resources.
