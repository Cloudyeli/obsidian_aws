## AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

The AWS Elastic container registry (ECR) is a managed AWS [[Docker]] registry service for storing, managing, and deploying Docker images.

There is no additional charge for Amazon [[ECS]]. You pay for AWS resources (e.g. [[EC2]] instances or [[EBS]] volumes) you create to store and run your application.

Amazon ECR is integrated with Amazon EC2 Container Service ([[ECS]]).

With Amazon ECR, there are no upfront fees or commitments. You pay only for the amount of data you store in your repositories and data transferred to the Internet.
