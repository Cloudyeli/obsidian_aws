## AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)

The **AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)** is an open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation.

It offers a high-level object-oriented abstraction to define AWS resources imperatively using the power of modern programming languages. Using the CDK’s library of infrastructure constructs, you can easily encapsulate AWS best practices in your infrastructure definition and share it without worrying about boilerplate logic.

-   Open-source software development framework to define your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages
-   Preconfigures cloud resources with proven defaults using constructs
-   Provisions your resources using AWS [[CloudFormation]]
-   Enables you to model application infrastructure using
    **TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, and Go**.
-   Use existing [[IDE]], testing tools, and workflow patterns
