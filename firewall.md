A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and permits or blocks data packets based on a set of security rules. Its purpose is to establish a barrier between your internal network and incoming traffic from external sources (such as the internet) in order to block malicious traffic like viruses and hackers.

## Stateful vs Stateless Firewalls

A [[stateful]] firewall allows the return traffic automatically
A [[stateless]] firewall checks for an allow rule for both connections
