## AWS CodeBuild

AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service that **compiles source code, runs tests, and produces ready-to-deploy software packages**.

-   With CodeBuild, you don’t need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. CodeBuild scales continuously and processes multiple builds concurrently, so your builds are not left waiting in a queue.
-   You can get started quickly by using prepackaged build environments, or you can create custom build environments that use your own build tools.
-   With CodeBuild, you are charged by the minute for the compute resources you use.
