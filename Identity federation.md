A **federated identity** in information technology is the means of linking a person's electronic identity and attributes, stored across multiple distinct identity management systems.

Federated identity is related to single sign-on ([[SSO]]), in which a user's single authentication ticket, or token, is trusted across multiple IT systems or even organizations. [[SSO]] is a subset of federated identity management, as it relates only to authentication and is understood on the level of technical interoperability and it would not be possible without some sort of federation.

Identity Federation (including [[AD]], Facebook etc.) can be configured allowing secure access to resources in an AWS account without creating an [[IAM user]] account.
