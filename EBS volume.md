An Amazon EBS volume isÂ **a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach to your instances**. After you attach a volume to an instance, you can use it as you would use a physical hard drive. EBS volumes are flexible.

-   EBS volume data persists independently of the life of the instance
-   EBS volumes do not need to be attached to an instance
-   You can attach multiple EBS volumes to an instance
-   You can use multi-attach to attach a volume to multiple instances but with some constraints
-   EBS volumes must be in the same [[AZ]] as the [[EC2]] instances they are attached to
-   Root EBS volumes are deleted on termination by default
-   Extra non-boot volumes are not deleted on termination by default
