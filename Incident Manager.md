## AWS Incident Manager
#(AWS [[Systems Manager]])

AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager enables faster resolution of critical application availability and performance issues. It helps you prepare for incidents with automated response plans that bring the right people and information together. With Incident Manager, you can automatically take action when a critical issue is detected by an Amazon [[CloudWatch]] alarm or Amazon [[EventBridge]] event. Incident Manager executes pre-configured response plans to engage responders via SMS and phone calls, links designated chat channels using AWS [[Chatbot]], and executes AWS [[Automation]] runbooks. Incident Manager helps you improve service reliability by suggesting post-incident action items, such as automating a runbook step or adding a new alarm, based on Amazonâ€™s post-incident analysis template.
