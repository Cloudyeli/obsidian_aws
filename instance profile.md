When you launch an Amazon [[EC2]] instance, you specify an [[IAM role]] to associate with the instance. 

*  An instance profile is a container for an IAM role that you can use to pass role information to an Amazon [[EC2]] instance when the instance starts.
*   You can [tag instance profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags_instance-profiles.html) when you use the AWS [[CLI]] or AWS [[API]].
