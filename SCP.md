Service Control Policies (SCP)s are a feature of [[AWS Organizations]].

- SCPs control the maximum available permissions in an AWS account
- SCPs do not grant permissions
- **NOTE: SCPs do not grant ANY permissions, they control the AVAILABLE permissions**

#### SCPs can be applied to:

* An individual member account
or
* An organizational unit ([[OU]])
