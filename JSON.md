**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. 
*   It is easy for humans to read and write. 
*   It is easy for machines to parse and generate.
*   JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. 
*   These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

JSON is built on two structures:

-   A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an _object_, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.
-   An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an _array_, vector, list, or sequence.

These are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages also be based on these structures.
