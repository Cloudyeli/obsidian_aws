AWS organizations allows you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage.

Available in two feature sets:

-   [[Consolidated Billing]].
-   All features.

Consolidated billing includes:

-   Paying Account – independent and cannot access resources of other accounts.
-   Linked Accounts – all linked accounts are independent.

Includes **root accounts** and **organizational units ([[OU]])**.

*   Use service control policies ([[SCP]])s to centrally control permissions for the accounts in your organization.
*   Policies are applied to root accounts or [[OU]]s.

## AWS Organizations has four main benefits: 

1) Centrally manage access polices across multiple AWS accounts. 
2) Automate AWS account creation and management. 
3) Control access to AWS services 
4) Enable consolidated billing across multiple AWS accounts 

Analyzing cost is done through the [[Cost Explorer]] (or TCO calculator), which is not part of AWS Organizations.
