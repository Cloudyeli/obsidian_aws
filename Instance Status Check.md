*   AWS is checking the software networking configuration of your [[EC2]] instance itself.
*   Makes shure that the [[OS]] is configured correctly, so that your [[EC2]] instance is operational and it's communicating with the network
*   If there is a problem with the Instance status check, it means it would need your involvment as an AWS customer to fix that problem.
