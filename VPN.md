Virtual Private Network (VPN) 

A virtual private network (VPN) is an encrypted connection between two or more computers. 

*   Securely access and exchange confidential data over shared network infrastructure, such as the public Internet.
*   Many VPNs use the IPsec protocol ([[IPsec VPN]]) suite to establish and run these encrypted connections. 
*   However, not all VPNs use IPsec. Another protocol for VPNs is [[SSL]]/[[TLS]], which operates at a different layer in the [[OSI]] model then IPsec.
