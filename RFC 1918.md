RFC 1918 **describes the use of IP address space deemed private by IANA, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority** (see, for example, RFC1918 - Address Allocation for Private Internets for details). Private address space is available for use by any organisation and is guaranteed to be not routable in the public Internet.

| RFC 1918 Range | Example CIDR Block |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix) | Your VPC must be /16 or smaller, for example, 10.0.0.0/16
| 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix) | Your VPC must be /16 or smaller, for example, 172.31.0.0/16
| 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix) | Your VPC can be smaller, for example 192.168.0.0/20


## RFC 1918 and private [[IP address]]ing

RFC 1918 describes the use of IP address space deemed private by IANA, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (see, for example, [RFC1918 - Address Allocation for Private Internets](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html) for details). Private address space is available for use by any organisation and is guaranteed to be not routable in the public Internet. What this means in practice is that any host machine which is assigned a private address defined by RFC 1918 cannot be reached "directly" by any other machine not in the hosting organisation's local network. Private addresses can be used for a number of reasons, some of which include,

-   Those instances where a host must be guaranteed to be isolated from the public Internet, for whatever reason.

-   To address public IP address space exhaustion. As more and more machines connect to the Internet, the availability of public IP addresses becomes more and more limited. Where an organisation is not able to augment the public address space it owns, one technique used in mitigation is to allocate private IP addresses internally, and to use a technique called NAT (Network Address Translation) to enable a machine with a private address to communicate with systems beyond the organisation's jurisdiction. What NAT does is to translate the source IP address in outgoing packets to a legitimate public address (or range of addresses) and to manage the housekeeping so that return packets are appropriately translated back to the correct internal addresses. This technique enables a "many-to-one" process in which multiple internal addresses can be translated to a much smaller block of public addresses, thereby conserving valuable public addressing resources PAT or Port Address Translation is an allied technique used essentially for the same purposes, ie. address hiding and conservation. Other than noting that PAT may be used where NAT is cited, it need not be considered further in this note..

-   A variant on the previous case in which, though an organisation may have a sufficiency of public addresses it nevertheless chooses to employ the methodology outlined above in order to enhance its public security posture vis-a-vis the public network. In this case the protected systems are typically connected behind an institutional firewall which performs the NAT function on behalf of the internal systems.

RFC 1918 defines the following address ranges as private,

-   10.0.0.0/8 (addresses 10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255 inclusive)
-   172.16.0.0/12 (addresses 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.255.255 inclusive)
-   192.168.0.0/16 (addresses 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255 inclusive)The addresses in these ranges are not routable in the Internet and may be freely used by any organisation for local purposes only.

Note that the address ranges are represented in classless IP addressing notation. For a description of this notation see, for example:

-   [CIDR: Classless Inter-Domain Routing.](http://compnetworking.about.com/od/workingwithipaddresses/a/cidr_notation.htm)
