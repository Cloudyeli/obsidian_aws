## AWS DocumentDB

Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) is a [[database]] service that is purpose-built for [[JSON]] data management at scale, fully managed and integrated with AWS, and enterprise-ready with high durability.  

Amazon DocumentDB is designed to give you the scalability and durability you need when operating mission-critical MongoDB workloads. Storage scales automatically up to 64TiB without any impact to your application. It supports millions of requests per second with up to 15 low latency read replicas in minutes, without any application downtime, regardless of the size of your data.

Amazon DocumentDB **allows you to encrypt your databases using keys you create and control through AWS Key Management Service ([[KMS]])**.
