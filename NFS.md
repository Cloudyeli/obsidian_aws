NFS, or Network File System, **is a network file sharing protocol** that defines the way files are stored and retrieved from storage devices across networks. The NFS protocol defines a network file system, originally developed for local file sharing among Unix systems and released by Sun Microsystems in 1984. This distributed file system protocol **allows a user on a client computer to access files over a network in the same way they would access a local storage file**. Because it is an open standard, anyone can implement the protocol.
