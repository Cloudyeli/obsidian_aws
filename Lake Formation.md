## AWS Lake Formation

AWS Lake Formation is **a service that makes it easy to set up a secure data lake in days**. A data lake is a centralized, curated, and secured repository that stores all your data, both in its original form and prepared for analysis. A data lake enables you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and guide better business decisions.

Creating a data lake with Lake Formation is as simple as defining data sources and what data access and security policies you want to apply. Lake Formation then helps you collect and catalog data from databases and object storage, move the data into your new Amazon S3 data lake, clean and classify your data using machine learning algorithms, and secure access to your sensitive data. Your users can access a centralized data catalog (for details, see [AWS Glue FAQs](http://aws.amazon.com/glue/faqs/#AWS_Glue_Data_Catalog/)) that describes available data sets and their appropriate usage. Your users then leverage these data sets with their choice of analytics and machine learning services, like [Amazon Redshift](http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/), [Amazon Athena](http://aws.amazon.com/athena/), and (in beta) [Amazon EMR](http://aws.amazon.com/emr/) for Apache Spark. Lake Formation builds on the capabilities available in [AWS Glue](http://aws.amazon.com/glue/).
