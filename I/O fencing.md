 I/O fencing

Input/Output Fencing is the process of isolating a node of a computer cluster or protecting shared resources when a node appears to be malfunctioning. As the number of nodes in a cluster increases, so does the likelihood that one of them may fail at some point.

I/O fencing protocols control write access in a shared storage environment to maintain data consistency. Your applications must provide write ordering for the attached instances to maintain data consistency.
