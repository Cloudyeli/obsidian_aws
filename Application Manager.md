## AWS Systems Manager Application Manager
#(AWS [[Systems Manager]])

AWS Systems Manager Application Manager helps you investigate and remediate issues with your AWS resources in the context of your applications. With Application Manager, you can discover and/or define your application components, view operations data (e.g. deployment status, Amazon [[CloudWatch]] alarms, resource configurations, and operational issues) in the context of an application, and perform remedial actions such as patching and running [[Automation]] runbooks. This streamlines operational workflows for your applications, avoiding the need to use different consoles to investigate and remediate operational issues. Application Manager will display data and alarms and take action on your existing container clusters in Amazon Elastic Container Service ([[ECS]]) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service ([[EKS]]) environments. Additionally, you can manage the full lifecycle of your AWS [[CloudFormation]] templates and stacks from within the Application Manager console.
