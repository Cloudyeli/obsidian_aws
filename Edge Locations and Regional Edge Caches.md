Edge locations are Content Delivery Network (CDN) endpoints for CloudFront.

There are many more edge locations than regions.

Currently there are over 200 edge locations.

Regional Edge CachesÂ sit between your CloudFront Origin servers and the Edge Locations.

A Regional Edge Cache has a larger cache-width than each of the individual Edge Locations.

The following diagram shows CloudFront Edge locations:
