Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts, [[EC2]] workloads, container applications, and data stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service ([[S3]]). 
GuardDuty combines machine learning ([[ML]]), anomaly detection, network monitoring, and malicious file discovery, utilizing both AWS-developed and industry-leading third-party sources to help protect workloads and data on AWS. GuardDuty is capable of analyzing tens of billions of events across multiple AWS data sources, such as AWS [[CloudTrail]] event logs, Amazon [[VPC flow Logs]], Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon [[EKS]]) audit logs, and DNS query logs.
