## AWS CloudWatch

CloudWatch is a performance monitoring tool and enables you to monitor your complete stack (applications, infrastructure, and services) and use alarms, logs, and events data to take automated actions and reduce mean time to resolution ([[MTTR]]). This frees up important resources and allows you to focus on building applications and business value.

| **Definition**                      | CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS resources and applications.                                                                                                                                             | CloudTrail is a web service that records [[API]] activity in your AWS account.                                                                                                                                             |
| **Monitoring Tool**                 | CloudWatch monitors applications and infrastructure performance in the AWS environment.                                                                                                                            | CloudTrail monitors actions in the AWS environment.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Usage**                           | With CloudWatch, we can: Collect and track metrics; Collect and monitor log files; Set alarms and visualize                                                                                                             | CloudTrail answers these questions: Who made a request? Which services were used? What actions were performed? What were the parameters for those actions? What were the response elements returned by the AWS service? |
| **Logs or Event delivery Rate**     | CloudWatch delivers metrics data in 5-minute or 1-minute periods for essential monitoring and detailed monitoring, respectively. By default, log data will be sent by the [[CloudWatch Logs]] agent every five seconds. | CloudTrail delivers an event within 15 minutes of the [[API]] call.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Example**                         | Suppose you have a web app running in your AWS environment; AWS CloudWatch can monitor bandwidth utilization, performance, and the traffic parameters of your app.                                                 | If your [[EC2]] instanceâ€™s security is compromised by an attacker, you can identify the culprit with the help of historical [[CloudTrail]] data Logs.                                                                          |
| **Integration with Other Services** | [[EC2]] instances, [[auto scaling]], load balancers ([[ELB]]), AWS [[SNS]], AWS [[SQS]], AWS [[RDS]], AWS [[S3]], AWS [[DynamoDB]], AWS [[CloudTrail]], other AWS resources.                                                                                      | AWS [[CloudWatch]], AWS [[Opensearch Service]], AWS [[Lambda]], third-party monitoring platforms, AWS [[SNS]], AWS, [[SQS]], etc.                                                                                                          |
