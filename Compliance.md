## AWS Systems Manager Compliance
#(AWS [[Systems Manager]])

AWS Systems Manager automatically aggregates and displays operational data for each resource group through a dashboard. Systems Manager eliminates the need for you to navigate across multiple AWS consoles to view your operational data. With Systems Manager you can view API call logs from AWS [[CloudTrail]], resource configuration changes from AWS [[Config]], software inventory, and patch compliance status by resource group. It also integrates with your AWS [[CloudWatch]] Dashboards, AWS [[Trusted Advisor]] notifications, and AWS [[PHD]] performance and availability alerts into your Systems Manager dashboard. Systems Manager centralizes all relevant operational data, providing a clear view of your infrastructure compliance and performance.
